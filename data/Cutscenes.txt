0$ Null$ Null$ 1$ In the corridors of a Fort within the upper left of a green field of a valley near the edge of the deep woods and at the foot of a great hill, two of its dwellers were discussing plans for the days to come. They were the lord, an old greyish field mouse and a pudgy vole both in brown clothing. They were discussing daily matters and had taken their talks to a corridor overseeing the great hall filled with tapestries for the warriors and wise creatures their order worships, cut off from the sunlight of the outside.
0$ Null$ Null$ 2$ It is long into their conversation about their upcoming feast when a young shrew came running from under the archway leading from the nursing chambers. The section of the abbey that served as an orphanage. He was calling for the mouse abbot and panted as he spoke.
0$ Null$ Null$ 3$ Shrew:£"My Lord!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 4$ Shrew:£*Pant* "Excuse me!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 5$ Shrew:£*Pant* *Pant* "Lord Dilecto!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 6$ Dilecto:£"Hm?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 7$ Dilecto:£"Yes child?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 8$ Shrew:£*Ahem* "Hazel is requesting a meeting."
0$ Null$ Null$ 9$ Vole:£"He has no authority to call a meeting involving the lord."
0$ Null$ Null$ 10$ Vole:£"What is it for?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 11$ Shrew:£"The Gowls… they are… conducting patrols of the woodlands north of here."
0$ Null$ Null$ 12$ Vole:£"And why does that matter!?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 13$ Vole:£"That may be unusual but it'"'"'s none of our concern."
0$ Null$ Null$ 14$ Vole:£"We are not their target."
0$ Null$ Null$ 15$ Dilecto:£"But someone could be."
0$ Null$ Null$ 16$ Dilecto:£"I approve and will be attending."
0$ Null$ Null$ 17$ Vole:£"But my lord the Gowls are no doubt looking for slavers$ traitors and humans."
0$ Null$ Null$ 18$ Vole:£"Enemies who’d do us harm!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 19$ Vole:£"Surely they are justified."
0$ Null$ Null$ 20$ Dilecto:£"We shall discuss this."
0$ Null$ Null$ 21$ Dilecto:£"Though I would prefer there to be no violence near our town."
0$ Null$ Null$ 22$ Dilecto:£"Besides, not all humans are evil, we had human friends during the war."
0$ Null$ Null$ 23$ Dilecto:£"Times would have been far grimmer without them."
0$ Null$ Null$ 24$ Shrew:£"They were... friends with Agrimus?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 25$ Vole:£"Why does every conversation we have with you end up involving the Scion Dean."
0$ Null$ Null$ 26$ Dean:£"I, um."
0$ Null$ Null$ 27$ Dean was embarrassed. He has always been very invested in this topic and often brought it up.
0$ Null$ Null$ 28$ Dilecto:£"Hahaha."
0$ Null$ Null$ 29$ Dilecto:£"It'"'"'s alright Dean."
0$ Null$ Null$ 30$ Dilecto:£"It has been so long since his time."
0$ Null$ Null$ 31$ Vole:£*Sighs* "About thirty years now."
0$ Null$ Null$ 32$ Dean:£"Um?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 33$ Dean:£"Do you think the next one will appear soon?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 34$ Vole:£"As great as that would be, the Woodlands are at peace."
0$ Null$ Null$ 35$ Vole:£"There is no need for a Scion."
0$ Null$ Null$ 36$ Dilecto:£"Despite the human killings that is."
0$ Null$ Null$ 37$ Vole:£"Sir Darrunt and his Gowls Knights have every right to deal with those vermin."
0$ Null$ Null$ 38$ Dilecto:£"Ralph!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 39$ Dilecto:£"That talk is too far, no one has any right another creatures life!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 40$ Ralph:£"But my lord!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 41$ Dilecto:£"Enough!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 42$ Dilecto:£"We shall discuss this during the meeting."
0$ Null$ Null$ 43$ Dilecto:£"Hm!?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 44$ Dilecto notices an elderly mole emerging from a nearby room.
0$ Null$ Null$ 45$ Dilecto:£"Plumm could you spare a moment?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 46$ Plumm:£"Yes M’lord?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 47$ Dilecto:£"I need you to let the other officials know that there is to be a meeting tomorrow after noon."
0$ Null$ Null$ 48$ Dilecto:£"Dean. Be sure to invite Hazel, we will need to have a word with the Gowls."
0$ Null$ Null$ 49$ Plumm:£"The Gowls!?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 50$ Plumm:£"Why?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 51$ Ralph:£"They'"'"'re sending patrols around our town and into Oldwyrm woods."
0$ Null$ Null$ 52$ Plumm:£"Good heavens!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 53$ Plumm:£"Well, I’ll be off then."
0$ Null$ Null$ 54$ Ralph:£"I’ll help spread the word."
0$ Null$ Null$ 55$ Ralph:£"Off with you Dean."
0$ Null$ Null$ 56$ Dean:£"Yes sir!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 57$ Plumm and Ralph head to the gardens, while Dean runs to the keep. Leaving Dilecto alone in the corridor. He moves to face the tapestry of an armoured mouse with a sword fighting a black demonic human-shaped figure wearing a tawny-furred cloak with blood red eyes. He looks at it with sombre eyes.
0$ Null$ Null$ 58$ Dilecto:£"Agrimus."
0$ Null$ Null$ 59$ Dilecto:£"Your successor as Scion."
0$ Null$ Null$ 60$ Dilecto:£"I wonder what kind of creature you have planned?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 61$ Dilecto:£"Whoever you pick I shall always trust your judgement."
