0$ Null$ Null$ 1$ In the corridors of a Fort within the upper left of a green field of a valley near the edge of the deep woods and at the foot of a great hill, two of its dwellers were discussing plans for the days to come. They were the lord, an old greyish field mouse and a pudgy vole both in brown clothing. They were discussing daily matters and had taken their talks to a corridor overseeing the great hall filled with tapestries for the warriors and wise creatures their order worships, cut off from the sunlight of the outside.
0$ Null$ Null$ 2$ It is long into their conversation about their upcoming feast when a young shrew came running from under the archway leading from the nursing chambers. The section of the abbey that served as an orphanage. He was calling for the mouse abbot and panted as he spoke.
0$ Null$ Null$ 3$ Shrew:£"My Lord!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 4$ Shrew:£*Pant* "Excuse me!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 5$ Shrew:£*Pant* *Pant* "Lord Dilecto!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 6$ Dilecto:£"Hm?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 7$ Dilecto:£"Yes child?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 8$ Shrew:£*Ahem* "Hazel is requesting a meeting."
0$ Null$ Null$ 9$ Vole:£"He has no authority to call a meeting involving the lord."
0$ Null$ Null$ 10$ Vole:£"What is it for?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 11$ Shrew:£"The Gowls… they are… conducting patrols of the woodlands north of here."
0$ Null$ Null$ 12$ Vole:£"And why does that matter!?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 13$ Vole:£"That may be unusual but it's none of our concern."
0$ Null$ Null$ 14$ Vole:£"We are not their target."
0$ Null$ Null$ 15$ Dilecto:£"But someone could be."
0$ Null$ Null$ 16$ Dilecto:£"I approve and will be attending."
0$ Null$ Null$ 17$ Vole:£"But my lord the Gowls are no doubt looking for slavers traitors and humans."
0$ Null$ Null$ 18$ Vole:£"Enemies who’d do us harm!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 19$ Vole:£"Surely they are justified."
0$ Null$ Null$ 20$ Dilecto:£"We shall discuss this."
0$ Null$ Null$ 21$ Dilecto:£"Though I would prefer there to be no acts of violence near our borders."
0$ Null$ Null$ 22$ Dilecto:£"Besides, not all humans are evil, we had human friends during the war."
0$ Null$ Null$ 23$ Dilecto:£"Times would have been far grimmer without them."
0$ Null$ Null$ 24$ Shrew:£"They were... friends with Agrimus?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 25$ Vole:£"Why does every conversation we have with you end up involving the Scion Dean."
0$ Null$ Null$ 26$ Dean:£"I, um."
0$ Null$ Null$ 27$ Dean was embarrassed. He has always been very invested in this topic and often brought it up.
0$ Null$ Null$ 28$ Dilecto:£"Hahaha."
0$ Null$ Null$ 29$ Dilecto:£"It's alright Dean."
0$ Null$ Null$ 30$ Dilecto:£"It has been so long since his time."
0$ Null$ Null$ 31$ Vole:£*Sighs* "About thirty years now."
0$ Null$ Null$ 32$ Dean:£"Um?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 33$ Dean:£"Do you think the next one will appear soon?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 34$ Vole:£"As great as that would be, the Woodlands are at peace."
0$ Null$ Null$ 35$ Vole:£"There is no need for a Scion."
0$ Null$ Null$ 36$ Dilecto:£"Despite the human cullings that is."
0$ Null$ Null$ 37$ Vole:£"Sir Darrunt and his Gowls Knights have every right to deal with those vermin."
0$ Null$ Null$ 38$ Dilecto:£"Ralph!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 39$ Dilecto:£"That talk is too far, no one has any right another creatures life!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 40$ Ralph:£"But my lord!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 41$ Dilecto:£"Enough!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 42$ Dilecto:£"We shall discuss this during the meeting."
0$ Null$ Null$ 43$ Dilecto:£"Hm!?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 44$ Dilecto notices an elderly mole emerging from a nearby room.
0$ Null$ Null$ 45$ Dilecto:£"Plumm could you spare a moment?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 46$ Plumm:£"Yes M’lord?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 47$ Dilecto:£"I need you to let the other officials know that there is to be a meeting tomorrow after noon."
0$ Null$ Null$ 48$ Dilecto:£"Dean. Be sure to invite Hazel, we will need to have a word with the Gowls."
0$ Null$ Null$ 49$ Plumm:£"The Gowls!?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 50$ Plumm:£"Why?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 51$ Ralph:£"They're sending patrols around our town and into Oldwyrm woods."
0$ Null$ Null$ 52$ Plumm:£"Good heavens!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 53$ Plumm:£"Well, I’ll be off then."
0$ Null$ Null$ 54$ Ralph:£"I’ll help spread the word."
0$ Null$ Null$ 55$ Ralph:£"Off with you Dean."
0$ Null$ Null$ 56$ Dean:£"Yes sir!"
0$ Null$ Null$ 57$ Plumm and Ralph head to the gardens, while Dean runs to the keep. Leaving Dilecto alone in the corridor. He moves to face the tapestry of an armoured mouse with a sword fighting a black demonic human-shaped figure wearing a tawny-furred coloured cloak with blood red eyes. He looks at it with sombre eyes.
0$ Null$ Null$ 58$ Dilecto:£"Agrimus."
0$ Null$ Null$ 59$ Dilecto:£"Your successor as Scion."
0$ Null$ Null$ 60$ Dilecto:£"I wonder what kind of creature you have planned?"
0$ Null$ Null$ 61$ Dilecto:£"Whoever you pick I shall always trust your judgement."
1$ 0$ 1$ 1$ Chapter 1
1$ 0$ 1$ 2$ Deep in the Oldwyrm woods north of the Fort a lone creature is wandering through the underbrush. It was a hedgehog. His quills sticking out of his jacket, hood and blue scarf. He had a travelling bag with various herbs and seeds. He was whispering into the air.
1$ 0$ 1$ 3$ Hedgehog:£"The rabbit seeks his burrow."
1$ 0$ 1$ 4$ There was a silence excluding the song of birds and insects of the setting summer. Part of a nearby boulder opened like a door and through it was the living room of a cottage. Out of the doorframe there was a woman. She towered above the hedgehog, his height not even making it to her waist. She had long dark hair that went down her shoulders and fair pale skin.
1$ 0$ 1$ 5$ In front of him a woman appeared. She towered above the hedgehog, his height not even making it to her waist. She had long dark hair that went down her shoulders and fair pale skin.
1$ 0$ 1$ 6$ Woman:£"Thay! It's good to see you!"
1$ 0$ 1$ 7$ Thay:£"And you too Florace."
1$ 0$ 1$ 8$ Thay:£"Where’s young Alder?"
1$ 0$ 1$ 9$ Florace:£"He’s inside."
1$ 0$ 1$ 10$ Florace:£"He still has to clean the dishes."
1$ 0$ 1$ 11$ Florace:£"Alder!!"
1$ 0$ 1$ 12$ Florace:£"Thay's" here!
1$ 0$ 1$ 13$ Inside the cottage, a boy with chestnut hair in a similarly light brown tunic that was worn, torn and noticeably small. He was cleaning plates in the kitchen. He was standing on a stool. He knew the hedgehog and enjoyed his company. He hurried to finish his task making sure each plate was spotless so he would not have to repeat the chore. After he had finished drying the last wooden spoon he was rushed to meet him. This Boy is Alder and this is his story.
1$ 1$ 2$ 1$ Thay and Florace are waiting for Alder in the clearing.
1$ 1$ 2$ 2$ Thay:£"Haha! How’ve you been Alder?"
1$ 1$ 2$ 3$ Alder:£"I’ve been great!"
1$ 1$ 2$ 4$ Thay:£"You’ve gotten bigger too."
1$ 1$ 2$ 5$ Thay:£"I remember when we were the same size."
1$ 1$ 2$ 6$ Alder:£"I'm not a toddler anymore."
1$ 1$ 2$ 7$ Thay smiled warmly at Alder, then turned to look at an elderly woman in the cottage door. She was a short and very wrinkled woman with a bent beak-like nose.
1$ 1$ 2$ 8$ Thay:£"Well."
1$ 1$ 2$ 9$ Thay:£"Better I'll be meeting with the witch."
1$ 1$ 2$ 10$ Thay:£"I'll chat with you both soon."
1$ 1$ 2$ 11$ Thay went to the cottage and seeing little reason to knock as he was clearly welcome, let himself in.
1$ 2$ 2$ 1$ As Alder talked with Florace, Thay came back out of the cottage.
1$ 2$ 2$ 2$ Thay:£"Thank you, Madame Kyla.
1$ 2$ 2$ 3$ Kyla:£"Yes yes. Come again."
1$ 2$ 2$ 4$ The old witch closed the door behind Thay who approached to speak to Alder and Florace.
1$ 3$ 3$ 1$ Florace:£"Alder!"
1$ 3$ 3$ 2$ Florace:£"I need you!"
1$ 3$ 3$ 3$ Alder looked back at Thay, disappointed that their conversation had to be cut short.
1$ 3$ 3$ 4$ Thay:£"Don’t worry about it lad."
1$ 3$ 3$ 5$ Thay:£"I’ll make sure you see me off.
1$ 3$ 3$ 6$ Alder:£*Sigh*
1$ 3$ 3$ 7$ Alder:£"Yes Florace?"
1$ 3$ 3$ 8$ Florace:£"We are out of meat."
1$ 3$ 3$ 9$ Florace:£"I need you to go to hunt an insect or two."
1$ 3$ 3$ 10$ Alder:£"Ok."
1$ 3$ 3$ 11$ Alder:£"Where do you want me to look?"
1$ 3$ 3$ 12$ Florace:£"Just outside the burrow."
1$ 3$ 3$ 13$ Florace:£"There should be a hunting knife on the table in the shed."
1$ 3$ 3$ 14$ Alder:£"Thank you."
1$ 4$ 4$ 1$ Thay:£"I’m heading off now lad."
1$ 4$ 4$ 2$ Alder:£"Already!"
1$ 4$ 4$ 3$ Alder:£"Well, take care than."
1$ 4$ 4$ 4$ Thay:£"I will."
1$ 4$ 4$ 5$ Thay:£"Goodbye lad."
1$ 4$ 4$ 6$ And with that, the hedgehog left. Leaving the burrow for lands unknown to Alder. He headed back to the cottage. Back to his daily chores of cleaning, gathering and grinding leaves until his hands were sore. As the day came to an end the residents of the cottage were unaware of the shadows that came ever closer.
2$ 5$ 1$ 1$ Chapter 2
2$ 5$ 1$ 2$ Dawn came, sunlight striking Alder’s face through the curtainless window. He began his day like normal, going downstairs to eat his breakfast of nuts and berries scavenged from the foot of trees and bushes, then clean the plates and cups using water gathered from rain or the nearest point of the river. The day was set to be a very mundane one, where Alder could only hope that a guest would come, just as Thay did the day before. Otherwise, today he will only be sweeping floors, chopping wood and foraging mushrooms allowing the hours tick by until it was time for the next chore.
2$ 5$ 1$ 3$ Alder:£*Yawn*
2$ 5$ 1$ 4$ The dull boredom was broken to Alder excitement when a squirrel he knew came down from the trees and ran into the area with the cottage. The squirrel was female but wore male clothing, strapped to her back was a bow and quiver and the tip half of her tail missing. She spoke to Alder in a loud whisper.
2$ 5$ 1$ 5$ Squirrel:£"Hi Alder!"
2$ 5$ 1$ 6$ Alder:£"Trissie!"
2$ 5$ 1$ 7$ Squirrel:£"Shh. Not so loud!"
2$ 5$ 1$ 8$ Trissie sprand up onto Alder shoulders to cover his mouth. She took a quick look at her surroundings.
2$ 5$ 1$ 9$ Trissie:£"I need to see Kyla as soon as I can."
2$ 5$ 1$ 10$ Trissie:£"I have something everyone should hear."
2$ 5$ 1$ 11$ Alder found Trissie fun to be around but it sounded like she was in a hurry. He could not help but feel dejected by her hast.
2$ 5$ 1$ 12$ Alder:£"Ok..."
2$ 5$ 1$ 13$ Trissie:£"Aw. Don’t make that face."
2$ 5$ 1$ 14$ Trissie:£"Say."
2$ 5$ 1$ 15$ Trissie:£"Why don't I give you some archery lessons before I leave?"
2$ 5$ 1$ 16$ As Alder brightens up at the thought. But those emotions were cut when Trissie mumbled.
2$ 5$ 1$ 17$ Trissie:£"You might need them."
2$ 5$ 1$ 18$ Florace:£"Triss!"
2$ 5$ 1$ 19$ Florace was staring from the entrance of the cottage door. She went back in with Trissie.
2$ 6$ 2$ 1$ Trissie had rested her bow and quiver on the wall and hopped onto one of the chairs on the table. Kyla was opposite her in her rocking chair while everyone else stood around the table as spectators. Alder walked over to take position next to Florace. With everyone gathered Trissie began.
2$ 6$ 2$ 2$ Trissie:£"I’ll make this quick!"
2$ 6$ 2$ 3$ Trissie:£"There are Gowl knights patrolling these woods!"
2$ 6$ 2$ 4$ Kyla and Florace sat upright and began muttering to each other.
2$ 6$ 2$ 5$ Florace:£"Do you think they know of the cottage?"
2$ 6$ 2$ 6$ Kyla:£"Not unless one of our clients has sold us out."
2$ 6$ 2$ 7$ Kyla:£"Even so their search shall come up empty."
2$ 6$ 2$ 8$ Trissie:£"I don’t know."
2$ 6$ 2$ 9$ Trissie:£"There's quite a few of them and they are setting up camps."
2$ 6$ 2$ 10$ Trissie:£"They seemed certain that they would find something."
2$ 6$ 2$ 11$ Kyla:£"My magic is strong."
2$ 6$ 2$ 12$ Kyla:£"They’ll never find this place."
2$ 6$ 2$ 13$ Trissie:£"I hope so."
2$ 6$ 2$ 14$ Trissie:£"Anyway, the woods are full of soldiers, most of whom appear to be new recruits."
2$ 6$ 2$ 15$ Kyla:£"That proves my point!"
2$ 6$ 2$ 16$ Kyla:£"Whatever they know, their sending saplings, they cannot be very confident about it!"
2$ 6$ 2$ 17$ Trissie:£"Being overseen by several captains apparently ordered by Darrunt himself!"
2$ 6$ 2$ 18$ The mood dimmed but Kyla remained confident. Alder had rarely been involved in conversations about the dangers of the outside world and was unsure how to feel. He whispered to Florace as Kyla dismissed Trissie’s warning.
2$ 6$ 2$ 19$ Alder:£"Who’s Darrunt?"
2$ 6$ 2$ 20$ Florace:£"He is the leader of the Gowls."
2$ 6$ 2$ 21$ Florace:£"He is known for hating humans more than anything."
2$ 6$ 2$ 22$ Florace:£"He won't come here though."
2$ 6$ 2$ 23$ Florace:£"Too devoid of what he hates."
2$ 6$ 2$ 24$ While Alder and Florace whispered to each other Kyla had relaxed back into her chair at the end of her rebuttal.
2$ 6$ 2$ 25$ Kyla:£"We’ll lay low for the next few days, we are well stocked and have enough water to last us a few days."
2$ 6$ 2$ 26$ Kyla:£"Thank you for your warnings, Trissie dear."
2$ 6$ 2$ 27$ Kyla:£"But I think we will be fine."
2$ 6$ 2$ 28$ Trissie:£"If you say so."
2$ 6$ 2$ 29$ Trissie:£"I think I’ll scarper out of these woods for the time being until things quiet down."
2$ 6$ 2$ 30$ Trissie:£"Alder?"
2$ 6$ 2$ 31$ Trissie:£"I promised you archery lessons?"
2$ 6$ 2$ 32$ Alder:£"Yes!"
2$ 6$ 2$ 33$ Trissie:£"Then meet me outside."
2$ 6$ 2$ 34$ Trissie:£"Trissie leaves through the front door. From inside the cottage, Alder could see her picking up a large stick and sticking it into the ground."
2$ 7$ 3$ 1$ After a while, the light of day dimmed as the sky turned orange signifying the day was coming to an end. Alder wondered if Thay and Trissie got away all right. The three residents of the cottage had roasted hornet for supper.
2$ 7$ 3$ 2$ Alder returns to his bed unaware that this would be his last time in it and that his life would never again be the same as it had been. Change is inevitable whether or not you want or even expect it.
2$ 7$ 3$ 3$ Alder:£"........."
2$ 7$ 3$ 4$ Alder:£"................hm?"
2$ 7$ 3$ 5$ Alder:£"Wha...?"
2$ 7$ 3$ 6$ Alder wakes in an empty clearing.
2$ 8$ 4$ 1$ Countless ghostly figures appear from the darkness between the trees. All of them were creatures of the woodlands from mice to wolves. But there were no humans among them.
2$ 8$ 4$ 2$ The ground in front of Alder started to burst up and a bulky mouse wearing a metal chest plate and a belt which was attached to a red cloth covering his waist, it held a sword by his right side. Despite being nearly half the size of Alder's leg, Alder was still intimidated. His face was that of a seasoned warrior, with the agile yet strong figure by mouse standards at least.
2$ 8$ 4$ 3$ The mouse walked up to Alder until he was standing right in front of him staring him directly in his eyes. In surreality only possible in dreams the mouse picked Alder up and took him over to the hole where he had emerged from. Alder was still surprised by his however and panicked but something was stopping him from moving how he wanted.
2$ 8$ 4$ 4$ Alder:£"Wait!"
2$ 8$ 4$ 5$ Alder:£"What’s happening!?"
2$ 8$ 4$ 6$ Alder:£"What are you doing!?"
2$ 8$ 4$ 7$ The mouse gently placed Alder in the hole and carefully reset the soil until Alder’s body was submerged in the soil with his head and hands sticking out at the surface.
2$ 8$ 4$ 8$ The mouse then grabbed the handle of his sword with his right paw and pulled it out. It looked as sharp and the metal shone like a star. Alder thought for a second that he was going to use the sword to cut him.
2$ 8$ 4$ 9$ Alder:£"Ahh!"
2$ 8$ 4$ 10$ The mouse’s expression displayed surprise and then an apologetic head scratch conveyed that he did not mean any harm, he pulled out the scabbard and fitted the sword back into it and placed the hilt in Alder’s hand.
2$ 9$ 5$ 1$ Alder took the sword by the grip, to his surprise, it grew in size to fit in his hand. Feeling the sword he found it surprisingly light and was comforting to hold as though it was always meant to be in his grasp.
2$ 9$ 5$ 2$ Turning the sword over Alder found another slot the same as the other side.
2$ 9$ 5$ 3$ ???:£"..."
2$ 9$ 5$ 4$ The mouse said nothing, only smiled, he beckoned Alder to kneel. Alder compiled and the mouse patted him on his shoulders as he nodded his head and closed his eyes and continued burning Alder. He was still silent but Alder had a strange sensation of a voice in his head saying to him...
2$ 9$ 5$ 5$ Good luck. My Scion.
3$ 10$ 1$ 1$ Chapter 3
3$ 10$ 1$ 2$ Alder woke up with the memory of what he dreamt still fresh and as clear as glass.
3$ 10$ 1$ 3$ Alder:£"hmmm."
3$ 10$ 1$ 4$ Alder:£"Oh!"
3$ 10$ 1$ 5$ Alder:£"It was a dream."
3$ 10$ 1$ 6$ Alder:£"..."
3$ 10$ 1$ 7$ Alder:£"Huh!?"
3$ 10$ 1$ 8$ Alder:£"What is…!?"
3$ 10$ 1$ 9$ As Alder turned to get up he realized that there was something metal in his hand.
3$ 10$ 1$ 10$ It was the sword that the mouse in his dream had given him.
3$ 10$ 1$ 11$ Alder:£"What!?"
3$ 10$ 1$ 12$ Alder:£"How!?"
3$ 10$ 1$ 13$ Alder unsheathed the sword partially and inspected the sword intensely. The blade shone in the light.
3$ 10$ 1$ 14$ Alder:£"Florace!!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 1$ The voice that called out was unknown to the residents. They looked through the windows to see a rat. He was new to them and was clad in armour. Kyla was not going to let in a complete stranger, especially given Trissies warning about the Gowls. They watch him for a bit unsure of what to do. Alder notices something moving behind him.
3$ 11$ 2$ 2$ Alder:£"Look!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 3$ Alder:£"There's someone in the bushes!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 4$ Kyla:£"Hm?!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 5$ Kyla:£"Good eye boy."
3$ 11$ 2$ 6$ Kyla:£"Florace, You have better eyesight than me, what do you see?"
3$ 11$ 2$ 7$ Florace:£"Two- No. Four creatures."
3$ 11$ 2$ 8$ Florace:£"I’m certain at least one of them is a stoat or a weasel."
3$ 11$ 2$ 9$ There was a glint from the bushes where they were.
3$ 11$ 2$ 10$ Florace:£"Did you see that?"
3$ 11$ 2$ 11$ Kyla:£"The reflection of light."
3$ 11$ 2$ 12$ Kyla:£"A dagger I should think."
3$ 11$ 2$ 13$ Kyla:£"They're Gowls for sure."
3$ 11$ 2$ 14$ Rat:£"There's no one here!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 15$ The weasel that Florace spotted arose from the bushes.
3$ 11$ 2$ 16$ Weasel:£"Don’t call out!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 17$ Weasel:£*Sigh* "Nevermind."
3$ 11$ 2$ 19$ Weasel:£"Wait here, the rest of you form a perimeter."
3$ 11$ 2$ 20$ Weasel:£"I’ll fetch the wizard."
3$ 11$ 2$ 21$ The band started walking away, leaving the rat to guard the area. The rat went over to the bushes and picked up a dagger from the bushes then went over to sit on part of a rock that was part of the disguised cottage. The back of his head was directly in front of the window Alder was looking out of. Even though the rat could not hear them Kyla and Florace discussed their next move in loud whispers to each other.
3$ 11$ 2$ 22$ Kyla:£"They know we are here we will have to move."
3$ 11$ 2$ 23$ Florace:£"I agree. But where?"
3$ 11$ 2$ 24$ Kyla:£"Hmm."
3$ 11$ 2$ 25$ Kyla:£"The boy can go to Forton with that sword the mice and such are sure to take him in."
3$ 11$ 2$ 26$ Kyla:£"It will be a benefit to all if the Scion can change minds about humans."
3$ 11$ 2$ 27$ Florace:£"By himself?"
3$ 11$ 2$ 28$ Florace:£"Shouldn'"'"'t we go with him?"
3$ 11$ 2$ 29$ Kyla:£"I’m not stepping a foot in another woodlander town."
3$ 11$ 2$ 30$ Kyla:£"The boy can go by himself."
3$ 11$ 2$ 31$ Florace:£"Absolutely not!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 32$ Florace:£"He’ll be killed!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 33$ Kyla:£"They are not going to kill him."
3$ 11$ 2$ 34$ Kyla:£"He’s the Scion."
3$ 11$ 2$ 35$ Florace:£"What about the Gowls!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 36$ Kyla:£"Again. Scion!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 37$ Florace:£"Again! Gowls!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 38$ Kyla:£"Well we can’t go with him!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 39$ Florace:£"I will!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 40$ Kyla:£"...What?"
3$ 11$ 2$ 41$ Florace:£"I will go take care of him as his guardian!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 42$ Kyla:£"Absolutely not!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 43$ Kyla:£"You will go with me!"
3$ 11$ 2$ 44$ Florace:£"I am not leaving Alder alone."
3$ 11$ 2$ 45$ Kyla:£"So again you would choose our servant over the women who raised, taught and loved you over these long years."
3$ 11$ 2$ 46$ Florace:£"..."
3$ 11$ 2$ 47$ Kyla:£*Groan*
3$ 11$ 2$ 48$ Kyla:£"We’ll discuss this later, we need to get moving."
3$ 12$ 3$ 1$ Everything was happening so fast for Alder. He had barely any time to think about what his life would soon be like when he got to Forton or the journey to the place. He had never ventured very far from the cottage and everything that he did know was from guests and books. These feelings were not anxiety but excitement. Everyone always said it was too dangerous for him, but now he had to leave the cottage he was where he was restricted, to go and live in a town of mice. He did not know what was in store for him but he wouldn't be a servant. 
3$ 12$ 3$ 2$ Rat:£"Who goes there!?"
3$ 12$ 3$ 3$ Alder felt his heart skip a beat and his body tensed from the shock of the rats outburst. He looked to where the rat was looking. He could just about make out a small figure carrying a large sack. The rat moved over to it.
3$ 12$ 3$ 4$ Rat:£"Don't Move!!"
3$ 12$ 3$ 5$ The rat reached into the grass and dragged out a weasel wearing a chaperon into the opening.
3$ 12$ 3$ 6$ Weasel:£"Please sir I have nothing of value."
3$ 12$ 3$ 7$ Rat:£"We’ll see about that."
3$ 12$ 3$ 8$ Rat:£"Show me what's in your sack."
3$ 12$ 3$ 9$ Weasel:£"Only cloth and my traveling supplies sir, I am just a penniless merchant."
3$ 12$ 3$ 10$ The rat takes the sack and digs through it keeping his eyes on the weasel.
3$ 12$ 3$ 11$ Rat:£"A merchant?"
3$ 12$ 3$ 12$ Rat:£"What are you doing out here?"
3$ 12$ 3$ 13$ Rat:£"The Gowl knights have been tasked with finding humans and spies in this forest."
3$ 12$ 3$ 14$ Rat:£"What brings a merchant into here?"
3$ 12$ 3$ 15$ Rat:£"You are not trying to make a deal with them, are you?"
3$ 12$ 3$ 16$ Weasel:£"No Sir!"
3$ 12$ 3$ 17$ Weasel:£"I am just passing north, but I got lost."
3$ 12$ 3$ 18$ The rat pulls out a large cloak from that sack, looks at it for a short moment, turns to the weasel and draws his dagger.
3$ 12$ 3$ 19$ Rat:£"Oh, lost are we!"
3$ 12$ 3$ 20$ Rat:£"Then can you explain why your cloth is tailored into man-sized cloaks?"
3$ 12$ 3$ 21$ Before the weasel could answer the rat pressed his knife against their throat.
3$ 12$ 3$ 22$ Rat:£"Anything to say for yourself."
3$ 12$ 3$ 23$ Weasel:£"Wait!"
3$ 12$ 3$ 24$ Weasel:£"Let me explain!"
3$ 12$ 3$ 25$ Alder thought the rat was going to kill the weasel. But then Kyla came over, waved her cane and chanted. The weasel took notice of her but the rat remained focused on him. Kyla opened her hand and a green light appeared in it. It sparkled and crackled, alerting the rat. He turned around and Kyla sent the light hurtling towards him. It struck him in the centre of the chest and he flew backwards.
3$ 12$ 3$ 26$ Rat:£"Aagh!!"
3$ 12$ 3$ 27$ He lay on his back. Alder stepped back in horror. Florace ran over and covered Alders’s eyes. He could only smell burning mould and hear the gargled words of the rat paralysed on the ground. Florace moved Alder away from him.
3$ 12$ 3$ 28$ Kyla:£"Come along!"
3$ 12$ 3$ 29$ Kyla and the weasel went indoors. The weasel's mouth was hanging open and twitching. Florace kept a firm grip on Alder and they looked at the rat who had now lost consciousness. They remained silent, still processing what had happened.
3$ 13$ 3$ 1$ Kyla:£"Well?"
3$ 13$ 3$ 2$ Kyla:£"What do you want?"
3$ 13$ 3$ 3$ Kyla:£"Who are you?"
3$ 13$ 3$ 4$ Weasel:£"Uh." *Ahem!*
3$ 13$ 3$ 5$ Jeb:£"M-My name is J-Jeb M-Ma’am."
3$ 13$ 3$ 6$ Jeb:£"I-I am a merchant."
3$ 13$ 3$ 7$ Jeb:£"I h-heard that there was a w-witch in these woods who might be in need of p-provisions to e-escape from the Gowls."
3$ 13$ 3$ 8$ Jeb:£"I-In exchange for something magical perhaps?"
3$ 13$ 3$ 9$ Jeb nervously took out some of the supplies he had. Kyla’s temper calmed slightly as she inspected them.
3$ 13$ 3$ 10$ Kyla:£"Hmmm.
3$ 13$ 3$ 11$ Kyla:£"I was going to throw you out but you may have brought us exactly what we needed."
3$ 13$ 3$ 12$ Kyla:£"Florace, take what you and the boy want."
3$ 13$ 3$ 13$ Kyla:£"I have an idea for his payment."
3$ 13$ 3$ 14$ Kyla went upstairs to her room while Jeb unpacked his supplies on the table. There were several nuts and dried fruits in terms of food. He also had two black wool cloaks. They were too big for Alder and small on Florace but they were usable. The only other items were several rolls of clean bandages. Kyla soon returned downstairs with three vials of golden potion and a bag of coins.
3$ 13$ 3$ 15$ Kyla:£"This vial contains golden dip. It can turn objects into pure gold like so."
3$ 13$ 3$ 16$ Kyla took out a bowl and poured one the contains of one of the vials into it. She then took a wooden spoon and dropped it in. The liquid glowed slightly and its volume went down until only the spoon remained. It changed from wood to solid gold. Jeb examined it greedily and Kyla held up the last two vials.
3$ 13$ 3$ 17$ Kyla:£"I’ll give you one in exchange for the cloaks."
3$ 13$ 3$ 18$ Jeb:£"Absolutely Ma'am!"
3$ 13$ 3$ 19$ Jeb:£"You can have the rest of my provisions for the other!"
3$ 13$ 3$ 20$ Kyla:£"No, that's what these coins are for."
3$ 13$ 3$ 21$ Kyla jangled the bag of coins and passed it to Alder.
3$ 13$ 3$ 22$ Kyla:£"The other is for you to get this boy to Forton."
3$ 13$ 3$ 23$ Jeb expression changed from eager to horrified.
3$ 13$ 3$ 24$ Jeb:£"But, Ma'am."
3$ 13$ 3$ 25$ Jeb:£"The Gowls are all over in that direction, with a human they will almost certainly kill me."
3$ 13$ 3$ 26$ Jeb:£"Even if we get to Forton, the mice won’t be too comforatble with him around."
3$ 13$ 3$ 27$ Kyla picks up Alder’s sword by the scabbard and hands it to Jeb. He is confused at first but he assumes it is additional payment.
3$ 13$ 3$ 28$ Jeb:£"No matter what you pay me that does not change the perrel of what you want."
3$ 13$ 3$ 29$ Kyla:£"Draw it."
3$ 13$ 3$ 30$ Jeb does what he is asked and to his surprise the blade withers and falls off the hilt.
3$ 13$ 3$ 31$ Kyla:£"Now pass it to the boy."
3$ 13$ 3$ 32$ Jeb now even more wide-eyed did as he was told and a new blade grew from the hilt when Alder took a grip of it.
3$ 13$ 3$ 33$ Jeb:£"Child..."
3$ 13$ 3$ 34$ Jeb:£"You are the Scion!"
3$ 13$ 3$ 35$ Alder nodded his head. Jeb thought to himself then let his thoughts be known.
3$ 13$ 3$ 36$ Jeb:£"We might be able to get through then."
3$ 13$ 3$ 37$ Jeb:£"But we will try to sneak around them."
3$ 13$ 3$ 38$ Jeb:£"Better safe than sorry."
3$ 13$ 3$ 39$ Kyla:£"I can create a diversion."
3$ 13$ 3$ 40$ Kyla:£"I can handle them and get away easily considering the quality of their soldiers in these parts."
3$ 13$ 3$ 41$ Florace:£"They will be bringing a sorcerer."
3$ 13$ 3$ 42$ Florace:£"They must know about this place somehow."
3$ 13$ 3$ 43$ Jeb:£"They know that there is a human witch."
3$ 13$ 3$ 44$ Jeb:£"Word reached the towns yesterday."
3$ 13$ 3$ 45$ Kyla:£"It matters not now."
3$ 13$ 3$ 46$ Kyla:£"You two buy what you need."
3$ 13$ 3$ 47$ Kyla:£"We leave when this sorcerer gets here."
3$ 14$ 4$ 1$ The sun was now setting. From outside the cottage within the dark shadows of the trees, the paw steps of the Gowls knights could be heard. Alder was the first to notice.
3$ 14$ 4$ 2$ Alder:£"They're here!"
3$ 14$ 4$ 3$ Florace:£"Then it's time to go."
3$ 14$ 4$ 4$ Kyla:£"Are you sure that's them?"
3$ 14$ 4$ 5$ Jeb:£"Must be."
3$ 14$ 4$ 6$ Jeb:£"I think I can see... six... no seven of them."
3$ 14$ 4$ 7$ Jeb and Florace looked concerned, Alder picked up on these feelings and stayed silent but Kyla started smirking which erupted into laughter.
3$ 14$ 4$ 8$ Kyla:£"Hee hee."
3$ 14$ 4$ 9$ Kyla:£"Hee hee Ha HA!"
3$ 14$ 4$ 10$ Kyla:£"That's it!"
3$ 14$ 4$ 11$ Kyla:£"They must know not that it is I they seek!"
3$ 14$ 4$ 12$ Kyla:£"Hee hee ha!"
3$ 14$ 4$ 13$ Kyla:£"This will be easier than I expected!"
3$ 14$ 4$ 14$ Florace:£"There may be more further out there."
3$ 14$ 4$ 15$ Kyla:£"In that case, I will need one to call for reinforcements."
3$ 14$ 4$ 16$ Kyla:£"Do you recognize any of the ones here?"
3$ 14$ 4$ 17$ The invaders were made up of two foxes, two badgers, an otter, a stoat and weasel. One of the foxes and the otter looked fairly young and stood at the back.
3$ 14$ 4$ 18$ Jeb:£"Not at this distance but judging by the species present I’m sure they have their best captains as well as what I think are squires with them."
3$ 14$ 4$ 19$ Jeb:£"Maybe they're educating them?"
3$ 14$ 4$ 20$ Jeb:£"Wait!"
3$ 14$ 4$ 21$ Jeb:£"The fox out in front! Look at his robes!"
3$ 14$ 4$ 22$ Jeb:£"He’s the sorcerer!"
3$ 14$ 4$ 23$ Kyla:£"Florace."
3$ 14$ 4$ 24$ Kyla:£"Are you truly sure you want to leave with the boy?"
3$ 14$ 4$ 25$ Florace:£"Yes."
3$ 14$ 4$ 26$ Kyla:£"It won’t be easy living in Forton."
3$ 14$ 4$ 27$ Kyla:£"The mice may not look fondly in your favour."
3$ 14$ 4$ 28$ Florace:£"I can live with that."
3$ 14$ 4$ 29$ Kyla:£"...Fine then go."
3$ 14$ 4$ 30$ Kyla:£"It is time."
3$ 14$ 4$ 31$ Kyla:£"Everyone into the undergrowth."
3$ 14$ 4$ 32$ Kyla:£"I’ll distract them until morning."
3$ 14$ 4$ 33$ Kyla:£"When the cottage is visable, move out of sight, hide and then continue running when reinforcements pass."
3$ 14$ 4$ 34$ The fox was barely visible but was wearing a robe and carrying a staff. The sorcerer for sure. It was time.
3$ 15$ 4$ 1$ Alder, Florace and Jeb put on enchanted cloaks and moved to hide in a dence bush. The soldiers walked past them unaware. The sorcerer Got to the centre of the spell looked around a bit but what he did not realise was that Kyla was standing in front of him, with another green sparkling spell directed at his face.
3$ 15$ 4$ 2$ Weasel:£"This is the place."
3$ 15$ 4$ 3$ Badger:£"Where’s Midge?"
3$ 15$ 4$ 4$ Weasel:£"He was here."
3$ 15$ 4$ 5$ Weasel:£"Midge!"
3$ 15$ 4$ 6$ Weasel:£"MIDGE!!"
3$ 15$ 4$ 7$ Sorcerer Fox:£"There might very well be something here."
3$ 15$ 4$ 8$ orcerer Fox:£"There are illusions on this stone."
3$ 15$ 4$ 9$ Sorcerer Fox:£"I’m dispelling them."
3$ 15$ 4$ 10$ Sorcerer Fox:£"Get ready for battle!"
3$ 15$ 4$ 11$ The sorcerer spun his staff around once above his head and speared the ground. The stone cracked glass and fell apart revealing the cottage in its true form as clear as day to the world. As soon as it fell, the fox tumbled backwards, a green light singing his face, not even giving him a chance to scream. In front of the shocked knights was Kyla, a dark green water like spell covers her hand and she slams her hands into the ground. As the escapees leave their home they hear the screams of their would-be hunters.
