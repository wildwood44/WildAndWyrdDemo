1$ 1$ Magic: The Basics$ lines$ 2$ None$ Illusions are spells designed to fool one or more of the senses of sight, smell, hearing, touch and taste. An illusion differs from hallucination as it does not affect someone’s brain and can be seen by all parties including the caster. The form of the illusion is limited to a certain shape depending on the spell but it’s appearance/attributes can be determined by the caster.

2$ 1$ Developers Note - Kyla's cottage$ story$ 1$ None$ One of the earliest questions I had for myself when storyboarding for the game was if humans are persecuted in this world how did Alder survive growing up. For his character, Alder needed to grow up amongst humans and the typical woodland creatures to make him comfortable when he interacts with either. The concept was for him to be a wanderer but this was scrapped as it would be unlikely for him to survive on the move. This led to the decision that he needed a stationary but isolated location to grow up. During this process, the concepts for the characters Florace and Kyla were added giving him company. To keep the cottage secret it needed to be concealed in case anyone came across it which made Kyla into a witch who used magic to hide the structure.

Some of my biggest functional achievements of my personal making while making this demo include the save and load functions, the skip feature, enemy AI and inventory management.
